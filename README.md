# Syd's DW Patches

This is a collection of patches for the NTSC-U Version of Digimon World 1 for the PSX.

The main goal is to fix bugs and allow more modding of the game, rather than being a full mod on its own.

Special shoutout goes to Vice04, whose work directly and indirectly contributed to some of the patches.

## How To Run

1. drag & drop a Digimon World ISO on the extract.bat
2. run rebuild.bat
3. use DigimonWorldPatched.bin
